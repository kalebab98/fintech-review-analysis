## Task 4: Insights and Recommendations
**Overview**
፟This task focuses on deriving actionable business insights from the cleaned and analyzed customer reviews of three Ethiopian bank mobile apps:

፟Commercial Bank of Ethiopia (CBE)

፟Bank of Abyssinia (BOA)

፟Dashen Bank

፟Building on sentiment analysis and thematic clustering (Tasks 1-3), this phase involves identifying key drivers of customer satisfaction and pain points, visualizing findings, and recommending improvements to enhance user experience and retention.

**Objectives**
፟Identify 2+ satisfaction drivers (e.g., fast transaction speed, intuitive UI) and 2+ pain points (e.g., app crashes, slow loading) per bank.

፟Compare user sentiment and themes across banks to highlight competitive strengths and weaknesses.

፟Create 3-5 clear, stakeholder-friendly visualizations illustrating sentiment trends, keyword distributions, and rating patterns.

፟Provide practical recommendations tailored to each bank’s app for improving customer satisfaction and retention.

፟Document potential biases or limitations affecting analysis results.

**Approach**
Insight Derivation
Aggregated sentiment scores per rating and per bank from Task 2.

Clustered review keywords into 3-5 thematic categories (e.g., UI/UX, Performance, Features, Support).

Cross-referenced themes with sentiment polarity to identify what drives positive and negative feedback.

Visualization
፟Created bar charts and line plots for sentiment distribution over time and across rating stars.

፟Developed keyword frequency charts and word clouds highlighting common themes.

፟Used Python libraries: Matplotlib, Seaborn, and WordCloud.


፟Pain Points: Lack of advanced features like budgeting tools, occasional slow load times.

**Visualizations**
፟Included in the /visualizations directory:

፟sentiment_by_bank.png – Average sentiment scores per bank.

፟rating_distribution.png – Distribution of user ratings.

፟keyword_clouds/ – Word clouds per bank showing frequent themes.
